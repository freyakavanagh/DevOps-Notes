# Managing File Permissions

## Does being the owner of a file mean you have full permissions on that file?

Yes, being the owner of a file grants you certain permissions on that file. The owner typically has the right to read, write, and execute the file.

## If you give permissions to the User entity, what does this mean?

Permissions given to the User entity apply to the owner of the file. This includes read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.

## If you give permissions to the Group entity, what does this mean?

Permissions given to the Group entity apply to a specific group associated with the file. This includes read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.

## If you give permissions to the Other entity, what does this mean?

Permissions given to the Other entity apply to everyone else who is not the owner or in the specified group. This includes read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.

## Question

Q: You give the following permissions to a [file: Use](file: Us "â€Œ")r permissions are read-only, Group permissions are read and write, Other permissions are read, write and execute. You are logged in as the user which is owner of the file. What permissions will you have on this file? Explain...


A: In the scenario where the user permissions are read-only, group permissions are read and write, and other permissions are read, write, and execute, and you are logged in as the user who is the owner of the file, here's what it means:

User Permissions (-r--------):<br>
The owner (you) has read-only (r) permissions. This means you can view the content of the file but cannot modify it.

Group Permissions (-rw-------):<br>
The group has read (r) and write (w) permissions. This means members of the group can read and modify the file.

Other Permissions (-rwx------):<br>
Others (users who are neither the owner nor in the group) have read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions. This means they can read the file, modify it, and execute it if it is an executable file.
